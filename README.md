# Cade Gray Dev Blog Built Using NextJS

This was cloned from the NextJS blog example and modified to suit my needs. I chose cloning an example as first project with NextJS to get comfortable with it for future projects.
I also needed a blog built quickly so I can start sharing my journey and helpful blog posts for other developers and tech enjoyers.
